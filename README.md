This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a homework for Social Hackers Academy in React. (Build a Todo List).

Homework:

This week's homework will extend your Todo List app from week 1.

1. Integrate state into your app
Instead of loading in a JSON file we want to put it into the application state. This creates a copy of it that we can change.

- Create a state object
- Import and move your JSON content to state
- Pass JSON from state to the components as props

2. Change the state
We can change the state by using a function called setState(). We'll start learning this by adding/removing new data to our state: by adding and removing a todo list item.

- Create a form that takes an Input field component
- Create a Button component to be used for adding new elements
- Define a function inside the class component that changes the JSON content to add a new entry
- Define a function inside the class component that changes the JSON content to remove the clicked entry

Tip: when adding or removing an item, think in terms of manipulating data types. In this case, think about how to add or remove an item from an array.
